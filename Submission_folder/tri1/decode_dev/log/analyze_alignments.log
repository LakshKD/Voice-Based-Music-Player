At utterance begin, sil accounts for 100.0% of phone occurrences, with duration (median, mean, 95-percentile) is (40,40.0,40) frames.
At utterance end, sil accounts for 100.0% of phone occurrences, with duration (median, mean, 95-percentile) is (64,64.0,64) frames.
Overall, nonsilence accounts for 76.9% of phone occurrences, with duration (median, mean, 95-percentile) is (4,14.7,30) frames.
Overall, sil accounts for 23.1% of phone occurrences, with duration (median, mean, 95-percentile) is (14,39.3,40) frames.
Overall, l_E accounts for 15.4% of phone occurrences, with duration (median, mean, 95-percentile) is (3,16.5,3) frames.
Overall, ɔ:_B accounts for 7.7% of phone occurrences, with duration (median, mean, 95-percentile) is (11,11.0,11) frames.
Overall, eɪ_I accounts for 7.7% of phone occurrences, with duration (median, mean, 95-percentile) is (11,11.0,11) frames.
Overall, e_I accounts for 7.7% of phone occurrences, with duration (median, mean, 95-percentile) is (75,75.0,75) frames.
Overall, h_B accounts for 7.7% of phone occurrences, with duration (median, mean, 95-percentile) is (4,4.0,4) frames.
Overall, əʊ_I accounts for 7.7% of phone occurrences, with duration (median, mean, 95-percentile) is (3,3.0,3) frames.
Overall, t_B accounts for 7.7% of phone occurrences, with duration (median, mean, 95-percentile) is (4,4.0,4) frames.
Overall, t_I accounts for 7.7% of phone occurrences, with duration (median, mean, 95-percentile) is (3,3.0,3) frames.
Overall, k_E accounts for 7.7% of phone occurrences, with duration (median, mean, 95-percentile) is (3,3.0,3) frames.
The optional-silence phone sil occupies 44.5% of frames overall 
Limiting the stats to the 60.8% of frames not covered by an utterance-[begin/end] phone, optional-silence sil occupies 8.7% of frames.
Assuming 100 frames per second, the alignments represent 0.0 hours of data, or 0.0 hours if sil frames are excluded.
Utterance-internal optional-silences sil comprise 9.1% of utterance-internal phones, with duration (median, mean, 95-percentile) = (14,14.0,14)
