analyze_phone_length_stats.py: WARNING: optional-silence sil is seen only 0.0% of the time at utterance end.  This may not be optimal.
At utterance begin, sil accounts for 100.0% of phone occurrences, with duration (median, mean, 95-percentile) is (114,114.0,114) frames.
At utterance end, nonsilence accounts for 100.0% of phone occurrences, with duration (median, mean, 95-percentile) is (3,3.0,3) frames.
At utterance end, eɪ_E accounts for 100.0% of phone occurrences, with duration (median, mean, 95-percentile) is (3,3.0,3) frames.
Overall, nonsilence accounts for 90.0% of phone occurrences, with duration (median, mean, 95-percentile) is (7,16.8,26) frames.
Overall, eɪ_E accounts for 20.0% of phone occurrences, with duration (median, mean, 95-percentile) is (3,5.0,3) frames.
Overall, r_B accounts for 20.0% of phone occurrences, with duration (median, mean, 95-percentile) is (26,46.0,26) frames.
Overall, sil accounts for 10.0% of phone occurrences, with duration (median, mean, 95-percentile) is (114,114.0,114) frames.
Overall, ɪ_E accounts for 10.0% of phone occurrences, with duration (median, mean, 95-percentile) is (14,14.0,14) frames.
Overall, ɪ_I accounts for 10.0% of phone occurrences, with duration (median, mean, 95-percentile) is (7,7.0,7) frames.
Overall, m_B accounts for 10.0% of phone occurrences, with duration (median, mean, 95-percentile) is (6,6.0,6) frames.
Overall, s_I accounts for 10.0% of phone occurrences, with duration (median, mean, 95-percentile) is (14,14.0,14) frames.
Overall, t_I accounts for 10.0% of phone occurrences, with duration (median, mean, 95-percentile) is (8,8.0,8) frames.
The optional-silence phone sil occupies 43.0% of frames overall 
Limiting the stats to the 55.8% of frames not covered by an utterance-[begin/end] phone, optional-silence sil occupies 0.0% of frames.
Assuming 100 frames per second, the alignments represent 0.0 hours of data, or 0.0 hours if sil frames are excluded.
Utterance-internal optional-silences sil comprise 0.0% of utterance-internal phones, with duration (median, mean, 95-percentile) = (0,0.0,0)
